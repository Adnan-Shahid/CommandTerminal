============================

Your team's Phase II grade is based on this scale:

    http://www.artsandscience.utoronto.ca/ofr/calendar/rules.htm#grading

The way we graded is as follows: your team starts with an A+. When errors and
problems are found, you will lose 0, 1, 2, or 3 letter steps, depending on the
severity. As an example, if you lost two steps, your team would earn an A-:

     A+ -> A
     A -> A-

You were asked to follow the Scrum process. A big part of that is to maintain
a product backlog and a sprint backlog. 

==== Product and Sprint backlogs ==== [up to -6]

Mark: -0.5

Mark deduction:
- PB items are too involved with the implementation. They should be somewhat general. (-0.5)

==== Java Style ==== [up to -6]

Mark: -1

Mark deductions:
- We need more packages than just "a2" (-0.5)
- Some class names (like CD) are not semantic. They should be noun phrases. (-0.5)

==== Design ==== [up to -6]

Mark: -2

Mark deductions:
- ProQuery's sortQuery method is too long. Perhaps you should've populated the hash table in another method, and implemented History in yet another method. (-0.5)

- No unified path handling. You should have some method or class that can change between strings and folders. (-1)

- Casting from Object is considered bad design. You should have some superclass for Folder and File. (-0.5)

Other comments:
- Instead of using Output to output strings exactly, you should return strings instead. This way you can manipulate them how you see fit.

- Make a hash table of <String, CommandInterface> and load all your constructors at the beginning. This is more efficient.

==== Javadoc ==== [up to -3]

Mark: -3

Mark deductions:
- Missing Javadoc on some methods (constructors, etc.) (-1)
- Missing Javadoc on classes (-1)
- Occasionally missing @return/@param tags (-0.5)
- Missing comments on many instance variables (-0.5)

==== Testing ==== [up to -6] 

Mark: -0.5

Mark deductions:
- Method names are not descriptive. (-0.5)

==== Correctness ==== [up to -6]

Mark: -2

Mark deductions:
- Code does not compile on the lab machines. Fix is simple (-1)

Test cases failed (-0.25 * 4 = -1):
1) Echoing without quotes
    >echo "Hello
    Expected: It shouldn’t echo Hello, since it is not enclosed in double quotes (as stated in the handout).
    Actual: Prints Hell.

2) Echoing and creating a new file given a valid absolute path.
    >echo “Hello” > /new/file.txt
    Expected: It should create a file called file.txt inside new with Hello as the contents.
    Actual: Shows an error (even though "new" is already created)

3) Listing files
    >ls file.txt
    Expected: It should print file.txt.
    Actual: Shows an error.

4) Pop directories from the stack
    >cd new
    >pushd /
    >popd
    Expected: It should change directory to root (/) first, then it should change to /new
    Actual: Changes to root, then to root again.
